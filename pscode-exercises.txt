// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

answer = when you add first number and second number together

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If number divisible by 2, = even. If number not divisible by two = odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

b) 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. 15 divided by 5 = 3. 3 = average of these five numbers

c) If numbers 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 are used, then 1 must be the smallest, and 5 must be the largest

d)The average is all the numbers added, divided by the amount of numbers present. So if you add 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, that is 5 numbers total. They add up to the sum of 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3. 5 is 4 more than 1, so it must be the largest number, while 1 is 4 less than 5, so it must be the smallest number.
